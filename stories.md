## Story 1: Fables and Fortune Hunters
&nbsp; An American businessman took a vacation to a small coastal Mexican village on doctor's orders. Unable to sleep after an urgent phone call form the office the first morning, he walked out to the pier to clear his head. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked, and inside the boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish. <br>
&nbsp; "How long did it take to catch them?" the American asked. <br>
&nbsp; "Only a little while," the Mexican replied in surprisingly good English. <br>
&nbsp; "Why don't you stay out longer and catch more fish?" the American then asked. <br>
&nbsp; "I have enough to support my family and five a few to friends," the Mexican said as he unloaded them into a basket.
